# Reize to the third in KDE Plasma using KWin scripting

This is a very simple KWin script that does two things:

* resizes the current window to 100 % height and 33 % width of the screen
* resizes the current window to 100 % height and 66 % width of the screen

I want to use this functionality for my 27" 2K screen. Of 50% makes windows to large so I want thirds or two thirds.

# Installation

Clone this repo somewhere. Then just run plasmapkg2 --install . inside the directory.

The script itself is SUPER easy to follow so checkout contents/code/main.js and customize it to fullfil your needs.
