* Reize to the third in KDE Plasma using KWin scripting

This is a very simple but flexible KWin script that does two things:

- resizes the current window to 100 % height and 33 % width of the screen
- resizes the current window to 100 % height and 66 % width of the screen

I use this functionality often with 27" monitor. The snap-to-half edges which makes 50% screen width windows too large or too small. I want 1/3 or 2/3 screen width windows instead.

The script itself is SUPER easy to follow so checkout contents/code/main.js and customize it to fullfil your needs.

* Installation

Clone this repo somewhere.
Modify and add additional keybinds to the script contents/code/main.js
Then just run kpackagetool5 --type=KWin/Script -i . inside the directory.
